## 🛠 My Contribution

- **Delete Functionality**: Developed logic to remove records from the appropriate CSV files with custom handling (e.g., quantity check for inventory, direct deletion for others).

- **Display (Data) Feature**: Implemented the feature to read from CSVs and dynamically display data in tabular format with plots and visually appealing charts using:
  - **Matplotlib** for data visualization  
  - **Tabulate** for table formatting  
  - **tkcalendar** for calendar widgets
